        As the editor of The Scene magazine — a publication of RedPoint Media —
        I assign, edit, write, and produce an entire magazine every single month
        that delves deep into arts and culture in Calgary. It’s kind of a dream
        job! I’m also the artist biography coordinator for the Sled Island Music
        & Arts Festival, where I write and edit over 200 artist biographies
        every single year. And hey, I love freelancing as well (hint, hint). I
        have bylines in fine publications like CBC Arts, Create Calgary, SAIT
        Communications, The Escapist and Avenue Calgary, and have had the joy of
        copywriting for companies such as POD Marketing and ATB Financial .

      <p className="text-black/70 dark:text-white/70 max-w-2xl">
        Feature articles, website content, inter-office memos, song lyrics, play
        scripts, artist biographies, press releases, podcast outlines, brochure
        materials ... You name it, and I&apos;ve written it! And I’m not half-bad at
        video/audio production or photography, either.

        But it all had to start somewhere, right? I’ll admit it: I’m a
        recovering theatre kid and current musician who has spent over a decade
        working in Calgary&apos;s arts and non-profit sector with companies such as
        Alberta Theatre Projects, Scorpio Theatre, and Swallow-a-Bicycle
        Theatre. As such, I’m a rockstar public speaker, director, board member,
        and administrative professional … And I can do a pretty killer Southern
        accent as well!

        Curiosity lies at the heart of all my work. I’m insatiable about my
        craft, and this excitement (I call it “stoke-i-tude”) guides my
        research, interviews, and interpersonal processes. I like talking to
        people. I like exploring the world. And I love writing all about it.
